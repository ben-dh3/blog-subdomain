[title]: <> (Codingame Question 27)

### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### You are a developer concerned with security and you want to protect your data.
### You decide to set up a password for each file in your project.
### In case you forget the password of the files, you will create an algorithm allowing you to find the password of the file in question.

### Here it is, for each character of your file name:

- If it is a number, multiply by the full length of the file name.
- If it is a letter, calculate the remainder resulting from the ascii code of the letter divided by the full length of the file name.
- If it is a special character, add the character index (0-based) 
- Finally, concatenate all the digits found

### Example

### Input
```javascript
 test.py
```
### Output
```javascript
 4334402
```

### Break it Down

- we need to loop through the input string and push a number depending on the character to our empty array
- if the character is a number, we need to multiply it by the length of the input string
- if it's a letter, we need to find the remainder from the ASCII code of the character and the length of the input string
- if it matches the special character regex then we can just push the index of the character (j)

```javascript
const file = "test.py"

let arr = []
for(let j=0; j<=file.length-1; j++){
    if(file[j] >= 0||file[j] <= 9){
        arr.push(file[j]*file.length)
    }if(file.charCodeAt(j) >= 65 && file.charCodeAt(j) <= 90 || file.charCodeAt(j) >= 97 && file.charCodeAt(j) <= 122){
        arr.push(file.charCodeAt(j) % file.length)
    }if(/[$&+,:;=?@#|'<>.^*()%!-]/.test(file[j]) === true){
        arr.push(j)
    }
}

console.log(arr.join(''))
```

### Output
```javascript
 4334402
```
