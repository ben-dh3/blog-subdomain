Hello! 

Welcome to my first blog post. My intention is to document my learning process and journey exploring coding, technology and my interests in general. 

I think it is valuable to pass on knowledge and this is the start of my practice. 

My writing will be concise and honest. May this project develop naturally - some evolutions I foresee are experimenting by displaying this content in  different forms, perhaps using different frameworks such as flask/django/vue.js - that I havent used before - and trying different formats such as podcast or video. 

The blog will have a number of subtopics - 

<b>Coding<b>

I am learning javascript at the moment with the aim of getting a job as a software developer, it helps me to learn how others approach coding questions and so I will share my own thoughts for solving problems hopefully it will help someone.

Problem solving skills are important in the application process for software development jobs - and, as is the case with getting better at anything the key I have found is to be CONSISTENT and DISCIPLINED, this means finding a lifestyle that supports a routine of practicing coding, consistency beats short sprints followed by burnout. 

<b>Notes/questions/ideas<b> on books I am reading at the moment. Non-fiction and philosophy mainly.
