### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### Output the factorial of the integer N
### Input
### An integer N to convert.
### Output
### The factorial of N
### Constraints
### -100 ≤ N ≤ 100
### Example

### Input
```javascript
5
```
### Output
```javascript
120
```

# Break it down

- the factorial of 5 is worked out by: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
- we need a variable to store the factorial total
- and a 'count' variable we can decrement
- we can use a while loop to multiply the total by the count, decrementing on each loop

```javascript
const N = 5;

let factorial = N
let count = N-1
while(count > 1){
    fac *=count
    count --
}

console.log(fac);
```
### Output
```javascript
120
```
