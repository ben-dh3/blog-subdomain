### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

 You must find the percentage (rounded up) that given characters make up in a given string (without taking into account the case).

### Input

- Line 1 : A string s
- Line 2 : An integer n for the number of given characters
- n next lines : A character c

### Output

- n lines : The percentage (rounded up) that the given character c makes up of the string s

### Constraints

- n â‰¥ 1
- c lower case alphabetic character

### Example

### Input
```javascript
Bonjour
 1
 j
```
### Output
```javascript
15%
```

### Break it down

- first we can convert all characters to lowercase as it can be ignored
- then we can use two for loops one looping through the letters in 'c', one looping through the string 's'
- if a letter in 'c' is equal to one in 's' then we can add to our total
- then we can divide the total by the length of the string and find the rounded up percentage

```javascript
const s = "the answer is pretty easy".toLowerCase();
const n = 3;

let total = 0
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const c = "ort";
    for(let j = 0; j <= s.length-1; j++){
        if(s[j]==c[i]){
        total += 1
    }
    }
}

console.log(Math.ceil((total/s.length)*100)+"%");
```

### Output
```javascript
20%
```
