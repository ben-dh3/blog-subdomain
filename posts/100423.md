### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### Input

- a string R showing the road

### Output

- N lines: Each line is a string for the next action (N is the total number of actions).

### Constraints

- R is always a valid string of instruction and will not be empty or contain any invalid characters.

### Example

### Input
```javascript
 ----R--R-L
 ```
### Output
```javascript
 Go 4 blocks Forward
 Turn Right
 Go 2 blocks Forward
 Turn Right
 Go 1 blocks Forward
 Turn Left
 You ve reached your destination
 ```

### Break it down

- We need to loop through R, increment a count of '-' and print how many we find, and print 'turn right/left' if we find R/L
- we can use a for loop to search through 'R' and a while loop within
- while the loop finds '-' we increment our total count and continue looping through 'R'
- then we can exit the loop and print our string with 'total' amount of '-'

```javascript
const R = "----R--L------------------------RR--L---L-R";

for(let i = 0; i <= R.length; i++){
    let total = 0
    while(R[i]=='-'){
        total += 1
        i++       
    }if(total != 0){
        console.log("Go "+total+" blocks Forward")
    }if(R[i]=='R'){
        console.log("Turn Right")
    }if(R[i]=='L'){
        console.log("Turn Left")
    }
}
console.log('You ve reached your destination');
```
### Output
```javascript
Go 4 blocks Forward
Turn Right
Go 2 blocks Forward
Turn Left
Go 24 blocks Forward
Turn Right
Turn Right
Go 2 blocks Forward
Turn Left
Go 3 blocks Forward
Turn Left
Go 1 blocks Forward
Turn Right
You ve reached your destination
```
