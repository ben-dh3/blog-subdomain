### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### You have a sum and difference of two numbers. Your task is to find these numbers.

### Input
- Line 1: An integer sum of these numbers.
- Line 2: An integer difference of these numbers.

### Output
- Line 1 : First number (smaller)
- Line 2 : Second number

### Constraints
- -100 ≤ sum,difference ≤ 150

### Example

### Input
```python
 92
 16
```
### Output
```python
 38
 54
 ```

### Break it Down

- to find the first number we can add the input sum and the difference and divide it by two
- then for the second number we can just take our first number away from the input sum
- we need to print the smaller number first, so we can just use a simple if/else for that

```python
import sys
import math

_sum = int(92)
difference = int(16)

num = int(_sum + difference)/2
num2 = int(_sum - num)

if num < num2:
    print(int(num))
    print(int(num2))
else:
    print(int(num2))
    print(int(num))
```
### Output
```python
 38
 54
 ```
