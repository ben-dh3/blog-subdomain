### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

 Terms of trade = sum of export prices divided by the sum of import prices.

### Input

- e_Prices = line of export prices separated by spaces
- i_Prices = line of import prices separated by spaces

### Output

- terms of trade as a percentage rounded down to the nearest integer

### Constraints

- There will be at least 1 price in each input line.
- There will be a maximum of 10000 prices in each input line.
- For each price given: 0<price<=100000000000

### Example

### Input
```javascript
 "5 5"
 "10 10"
 ```

### Output
```javascript
 50%
 ```

 ### Break it down

- first we need to split on the space to separate the numbers in the string
- then we can use a forEach function to add "ePrices" and "iPrices" to their respective totals
- then we can convert to a percentage and round it down using Math.floor

```javascript
const ePrices = "5 5".split(' ');
const iPrices = "10 10".split(' ');

let eTotal = 0
let iTotal = 0
ePrices.forEach((x) => {
    eTotal += parseInt(x)
})

iPrices.forEach((x) => {
    iTotal += parseInt(x)
})

console.log(Math.floor((eTotal / iTotal)*100) + '%')
```

### Output
```javascript
 50%
 ```
