### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### In a chess club, people can bring chess pieces to sell. The cost of the pieces is the chess value of each one (9 for the queen, 5 for the rook, 4 for the king, 3 for the bishop and knight, and 1 for each pawn) multiplied by $100 in the event that the set does not include a king, or $200 if it does.

### The objective is to calculate the price of any given 5-piece set.

### Constraints

### Input
- A line containing a String S, consisting of 5 characters.
- Each one indicates a piece: "Q" for queen, "K" for king, "B" for bishop, "N" for knight, "P" for pawn, and "R" for rook. Characters can be repeated indicating more than one piece of the same value

### Output
- A single line containing the numeric value of the total amount of money the bazaar will pay

### Example

### Input
```javascript
 PPPPP
 ```
### Output
```javascript
 500
 ```
### Break it Down
- first we can loop through the input string and add the chess values to our total
- then we can loop through the str again, if we find a 'K' we can return the total * 200
- after the loop we can return the total * 100, if we don't find a king

```javascript
const str = "QRKBN";
let total = 0
for(let i = 0; i <= str.length-1; i++){
    if(str[i]==="Q"){
        total+=9
    }if(str[i]==="R"){
        total+=5
    }if(str[i]==="K"){
        total+=4
    }if(str[i]==="B"||str[i]==="N"){
        total+=3
    }if(str[i]==="P"){
        total+=1
    }
}

for(let j = 0; j <= str.length; j++){
    let sum = 0
    if(str[j]==="K"){
        return console.log(total*200)
    }
    
}
return console.log(total*100)
```
### Output
```javascript
 4800
 ```
