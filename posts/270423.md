### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### In golf course, each hole has a "par", value which is the maximum number of swings that players should ideally need to clear the hole.

### Once a player has cleared the hole, the par is subtracted from the player's effective swing count, resulting in the player's score for that hole (i.e. 2 swings for a par 3 scores -1).

### The final score for a player on a course is the total of his scores for each hole in the course.

### Given a score card for a 18-hole course, your program must output the player's score.

### Input
- Line 1: 18 numbers separated by spaces, representing the pars for each hole.
- Line 2: 18 numbers separated by spaces, representing the player's swing count for each hole.

### Output
- Line 1: the player's final score for the course.

### Example

### Input
```python
 4 4 3 4 4 5 4 3 5 4 3 4 5 4 4 3 4 5
 4 3 2 4 3 4 3 3 4 4 3 4 6 4 5 3 3 4
```
### Output
```python
 -6
```

### Break it down
- the par needs to be subtracted from the players score
- while the score for each hole needs to be added on
- we can loop through the par input and take it away from our score, and loop through the score and add it on to our final score

```python
import sys
import math

score = 0

for i in '4 4 3 4 4 5 4 3 5 4 3 4 5 4 4 3 4 5'.split():
    score -= int(i)

for i in '4 3 2 4 3 4 3 3 4 4 3 4 6 4 5 3 3 4'.split():
    score += int(i)

print(score)
```

### Output
```python
 -6
```
