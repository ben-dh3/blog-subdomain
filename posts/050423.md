 The game mode is REVERSE: You do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the following set of tests:

 Hello world!
 ```

 ```javascript
 ****************
 * Hello world! *
 ****************
  ```

- 02 Test 2

### Input

```javascript
 Can you do it?
 ```
### Expected output
 
 ```javascript
 ******************
 * Can you do it? *
 ******************
 ```

- 03 Test 3

### Input

```javascript

 ```

### Expected output
 
 ```javascript
 **********************
 * CodinGame is cool! *
 **********************
 ```

- 04 Test 4

### Input

```javascript
 1234567890
 ```
### Expected output

 ```javascript
 **************
 * 1234567890 *
 **************
```
# Break it down
- we can use multiple console.log()'s to output the three lines to the console
- first line will use the string.repeat() function to multiply the '*'s for the length of our string 'A' + 4 to make the pattern
- second line will output our pattern with the string 'A' in between

```javascript
const A = "1234567890";

console.log("*".repeat(A.length+4))
console.log("* "+A+" *")
console.log("*".repeat(A.length+4))
```

### Output

 ```javascript
 **************
 * 1234567890 *
 **************
```
