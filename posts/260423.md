### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### Suppose Zeno wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before she can get there, she must get halfway there. Before she can get halfway there, she must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, she must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on.

### Zenos every time she makes a step she travels the distance mentioned earlier

### What will be the distance that she travelled after s steps

### example:

### start = 0
### end = 100
### steps = 5
- in step 1 she will travel the distance 50.0
- in step 2 she will travel the distance 75.0
- in step 3 she will travel the distance 87.5
- in step 4 she will travel the distance 93.75
- in step 5 she will travel the distance 96.875
- 96.875 round up will be 97
- so the output should be 97

### Input
- line 1 : start : integer the position where Zeno will start
- line 2 : end : integer the position where is she going
- line 3 :steps : integer how many steps will she take

### Output
- output the distance that zeno travelled after s steps rounded

### Constraints
- 0 <= start <= 10**4
- 0 <= end <= 10**8
- 0 <= steps <= 100
- start < end

### Example

### Input
```python
 0
 100
 5
```
### Output
```python
 97
 ```

### Break it down

- we need to halve the distance for each of the steps, and print the difference between the end and the halved distance after finishing the steps.
- we can then round up the result

```python
import sys
import math

start = 0
end = 100
steps = 5
t = 0

distance = end
for i in range(steps):
    distance /= 2
    t = end - distance
    
print(math.ceil(t))
```
### Output
```python
 97
 ```
