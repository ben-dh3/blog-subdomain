### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

Given two integers representing the beginning and end of a line, print "Overlap" if the integers overlap with another input of two integers. Otherwise print "Not overlap".

### 01 Test 1

### Input
```javascript
1 5
4 9
```
### Expected output
```javascript
Overlap
```

### Break it down

- we can use an 'if' statement to define the different parameters for an overlap
- we need to define parameters for when begin/end1 is infront and behind begin/end2

```javascript
const begin1 = -2;
const end1 = 6;

const begin2 = -7;
const end2 = -3;

if(begin2<end1&&end2<begin1||end1<begin2&&end1<end2){
    console.log("Not overlap")
    }else{console.log("Overlap")}
```
### Expected output
```javascript
Not overlap
```
