# The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### What is the most common letter used in a given string ? The string only contains lowercase letters and spaces.

### INPUT:
### words, a string.

### OUTPUT:
### The most used letter in words.

### EXAMPLE:
### Input
```javascript
'always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job'
```
### Output
```javascript
 'o'
```

# break it down

### - we need to count the number of times each letter appears in the string, and return the most used letter
### - one way is to create a dictionary and store the letter and number of times it appears
### - we can split('') the string and create an array of individual characters

```javascript
let letters = "hello world".split('');
```
### - loop through the characters and add them to the dictionary, and check if a letter key already exists (you cannot += an undefined value)

```javascript
let dict = {}
for(let i = 0; i <= letters.length -1; i++){
    if(letters[i] in dict){
        dict[letters[i]] += 1
    }else{
        dict[letters[i]] = 1
    }
}
```
### - now we have a dictionary of the letters and how many times they appear
### - we can sort the dictionary by the keys with the highest value with Object.keys()
```javascript
let order = Object.keys(dict).sort((a, b) => {
    if(dict[a] > dict[b]){
        return -1
    }
    if(dict[a] < dict[b]){
        return 1
    }else{
        return 0
    }
})
```
### Output
```javascript
console.log(order[0])
'l'
