[title]: <> (Amazon Interview Question)

The following is a question from my application process for an apprenticeship at Amazon:

Given a measured file transfer time in seconds and file size in [mebibytes] (MiB), write a program to calculate the network's bandwidth in [Megabits per second] (Mb/s).

Assume that all network capacity is used for the file data transfer, there is no overhead, loss, congestion, or contention.

Input:

Two space-delimited positive integers:

1. File size in MiB
2. Transfer time in seconds

For example:

```javascript
400 336
```
Output:

Print an integer number that is the network's bandwidth in Mb/s.

Round the calculated real value up to the smallest integer that is not less than the result. For the example above, the output would be:

```javascript
10
```
Break it Domn

//given a file transfer time in seconds and file size in mebibytes(MiB)
//calculate bandwidth in megabits per second
//print integer in Mb/s
//round the real value up

convert mibibytes to megabits
in order to convert, split the two integers to make them easily manageable
create two keys
in order to map them to the values in input they need to be an array
split the string on the white space
map the keys to the values, and convert the strings to integers

```javascript
const input3 = "400 336"

const [MiB, time] = input3.split(' ').map(x => parseInt(x))
```
now we can do our conversion

```javascript
let MB = Math.floor(MiB * 8.389)
```

and divide megabits by time to get out megabits per second

```javascript
console.log(Math.ceil(MB / time))
```
