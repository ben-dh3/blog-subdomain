### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### You are given a string. You must print the least and most occurring alphabetical characters in the string. Case sensitive. If two characters appear at the same frequency, we will take the one that appears first in the string.

### Input
- Line 1: The string.

### Output
- Two space separated characters.

### Constraints
- 0 < string.length â‰¤ 50

### Example

### Input
```python
 Hello world
 ```
### Output
```python
 H l
 ```

### Break it down

- one way to solve is to first create a dictionary, recording each letter and the number of times it appears
- to generate the desired output we can sort from least to most frequent and add the letter that appears first + ' ' to our output string
- we can then sort from most frequent to least and add the character that appears first to our output

```python

import sys
import math

string = "Hello world"

dict = {}

for i in string:
    if i in dict:
        dict[i] += 1
    else:
        dict[i] = 1

output = ''

for l in sorted(dict, key=dict.get):
    output += l + ' '
    break
for l in sorted(dict, key=dict.get, reverse=True):
    output += l
    break

print(output)
```

### Output
```python
 H l
 ```
