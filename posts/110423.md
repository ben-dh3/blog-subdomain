### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

 The game mode is REVERSE: You do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the following set of tests:

### 01 Test 1

### Input
```javascript
higHlIght
```
### Expected output
```javascript
HI
```
### 02 Test 2

### Input
```javascript
let me be a codiNgame hERo on Demand.
```
### Expected output
```javascript
NERD
```

### Break it down

- we just need to print the capital letters in a string
- we can just use a regex to filter out the letters we need
- and convert back to a string with join()
```javascript
const S = "let me be a codiNgame hERo on Demand."

console.log(S.match(/[A-Z]/g).join(''));
```
### Expected output
```javascript
NERD
```
