[title]: <> (Codingame Question 30)

### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

### Due to a muggle infestation at Hogwarts, you are required to write code to sort wizards from non-wizards.

### Conveniently wizards all have the letters in 'wizard' in their names.

### Input
- An integer N for the number of people trying to enter the castle.
- The next N lines are the names of the people trying to enter the castle.

### Output
- For every N person trying to enter the castle print either "Is a wizard" if you catch wizard or "Not a wizard" if they are not a wizard.

### Constraints
- 2 < N < 11

### Rules for names:
- Each name will be 8 to 30 characters long
- Each name will have 1 space and 2 capital letters

### Example

### Input
```python
 6
 Sofia Amberson
 Turtle Tortise
 Mike Pothole
 Wayne Drimaz
 Wave Trainor
 Meghan Title
```
### Output
```python
 Not a wizard
 Not a wizard
 Not a wizard
 Is a wizard
 Not a wizard
 Not a wizard
 ```

### Break it down
- we can write a function to return whether all the letters in 'wizard' appear in our names input
- lowercase the string to make it easier to sort through the characters
- we can loop through the letters in wizard, if they don't appear in our names string, we return 'Not a wizard', else, 'Is a wizard'

```python
names = 'Wayne Drimaz'.lower()

def wizard():
    for i in 'wizard':
        if i not in names:
            return print('Not a wizard') 
            
    return print('Is a wizard') 
wizard() 
``` 

### Output
```python
 Is a wizard
 ```
