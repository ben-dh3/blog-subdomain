<b>The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

count the 1s in the 8 bits and multiply the resulting integer by 2</b>

Test 1
Input

```javascript
00101110
```
Output:

```javascript
8
```

<b>Break it down</b>

//we can use a for loop to search through the input and find the 1s
//if it's a 1 we can add it to a total
//return total * 2

```javascript
const _byte = 00101110;

let total = 0
for(let i = 0; i <= _byte.length -1; i++){
    if(_byte[i] == 1){
        total += 1
    }
}

console.log(total * 2);
```

Output:

```javascript
8
```
