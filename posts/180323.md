<b>The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:</b>

The program:
Your program must output the string given as input with converted case. All words must start with an uppercase letter and the remaining letters must be in lowercase.

A word can be one letter long and multiple spaces can separate the words.

INPUT:
A string S.

OUTPUT:
A string containing a title case version of S.

CONSTRAINTS:
S contains at least 1 word.
S contains only alphabetical characters and spaces.
S contains less than 1000 characters.

EXAMPLE:
Input
heLLo world
Output
Hello World

<b>Break it down</b>

//first lowercase the string and split into individual words

```javascript
const S = "heLLo worLd";

const words = S.toLowerCase().split(" ");
```

//then we can create an array
//use a forEach() to iterate over each word
//we can push the uppercase first letter of each word to our array
//and use substring to push the rest of the word
//console.log the array and join() it to turn back to a string

```javascript

let newArr = []
words.forEach((word) => {
    newArr.push(word[0].toUpperCase() + word.substring(1)) 
})
console.log(newArr.join(' '))
```

Output:

```javascript
Hello World
```
