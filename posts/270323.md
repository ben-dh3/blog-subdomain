### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

# The game mode is REVERSE: You do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the following set of tests:

### EXAMPLE:
### Input
```javascript
"The _ dog barked."
1
"brown"
```
### Output
```javascript
"The brown dog barked."
```

### Input
```javascript
"The _ put on his red _."
2
"clown"
"nose"
```
### Output
```javascript
"The clown put on his red nose."
```
### Break it down
- we need to replace the '_' in the order they appear, with the words in the order they appear, can use a 'for' loop to iterate through each of them.
- first we will split the word input on each new line to separate the words
```javascript
let statement = "The _ put on his red _."
let n = 2;
let word = "clown\nnose".split('\n');
```

- then we can loop through each input in order
- when we find a '_' we can update statement with the new word in its place
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i <= word.length -1; i++){
    for(let j = 0; j <= statement.length -1; j++){
    if(statement[j] === '_'){
    statement = statement.substring(0,j) + word[i] + statement.substring(j+1)
    break
}
}}
return console.log(statement)
```
### Output
```javascript
"The clown put on his red nose."
```
