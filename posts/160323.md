The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

This game mode is reverse: you do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the tests:

Test 1
Input

```javascript
2
2
```
Output:

```javascript
'OO'
'OO'
```
Test 2
Input

```javascript
4
1
```
Output:

```javascript
'O'
'O'
'O'
'O'
```

Break it down

//we are given the height and width
//we can use the Array().fill() function to fill an array with 'O's
//and convert back to a string with join()
//we can use a for loop to limit the amount of times we print to the console

```javascript
const height = 6
const width = 5

for(let i = 1; i <= height; i++){
    console.log(Array(width).fill('O').join(''))
}
```

Output:

```javascript
'OOOOO'
'OOOOO'
'OOOOO'
'OOOOO'
'OOOOO'
'OOOOO'
```
