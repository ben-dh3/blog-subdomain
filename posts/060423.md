### The following is a question from codingame, clash of code:

 While Ignoring any special chars and spaces, output the absolute difference between uppercase and lowercase character count.
 
### Input

- A string s of one line with almost any kind of printable ASCII characters.

### Output
- The resulting integer

### Constraints

- s does not contain any whitespace characters except for spaces. It may contain uppercase and lowercase letters as well as digits and special chars.
- s is not longer than 1000 chars.

### Example

### Input
```javascript
"Pretty simple" 
```

### Output
```javascript
 10
```
### Break it down

- we can find uppercase and lowercase characters by searching their ASCII codes
- we can loop through 's' and increment our counters for lowercase and uppercase
- then use Math.abs() to find the difference between our counts

```javascript
const s = "Pretty simple"

let lower = 0
let upper = 0

for(let i=0; i <= s.length-1; i++){
    if(s.charCodeAt(i) >= 65 && s.charCodeAt(i) <= 90){
        upper += 1
    }if(s.charCodeAt(i) >= 97 && s.charCodeAt(i) <= 122){
        lower += 1
    }
}
console.log(Math.abs(upper - lower))
```
### Output
```javascript
 10
```
